Followed the above guide, making my own revisions and corrections when something was missing or inaccurate.

## planned changes
- correct buggy id setting (easy to cause duplicate ids since it uses array.length+1 instead of some form of "highest id" + 1)
- styling improvements... buttons and form spacing
- ability to save/load to/from local storage
- expand tasks to include a description, created date, and due date
